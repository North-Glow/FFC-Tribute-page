          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>The history of steel production and implementation can be traced back almost 4,000 years to the start of the iron age. The earliest archeological excavation of early examples are dated around 1800 BC; since then it has weathered the ages, weaving its way through the antiquity of the Roman Empire, the Spartans, Chinese dynasties, all way the way to countless modern applications.

          <p id="tribute-info">Although it is impossible to pinpoint who invented steel, a look at steel production in history can help give us a snapshot of those responsible for its emergence as one of the most important substances of the modern era.</p>

          <h3 id="13bc">I. 13th century BC</h3>
          <p>The earliest evidence of steel production can be traced back to early blacksmiths in the 13th century who discovered that iron become harder, stronger and more durable when carbon was introduced after being left in coal furnaces.</p>
          <h3 id="6bc">II. 6th century BC</h3>
          <p>Wootz steel was born in ancient India and can be traced as far back as the 6th century BC. Craftsmen in southern India used crucibles to smelt wrought iron with charcoal to produce ‘wootz’ steel – a material that is still admired today for its sharp and tough nature, as well as the its most distinguishing feature: swirling patterns caused by bands of clustered Fe3C particles.</p>
          <h3 id="3ad">III. 3rd century AD</h3>
          <p>China is commonly credited with being the first mass producers of high-quality steel. They likely used techniques similar to the Bessemer process, which was only developed and popularised in Europe in the 19th century. Early examples of high-quality steel in China can be traced back to the 2nd century BC, with mass production taking off in the 3rd century AD.</p>
          <h3 id="4ad">IV. 4th century AD</h3>
          <p>The Iron Pillar of Delhi, erected in roughly 402 AD, is the oldest surviving example of rust-resistant steel.</p>
          <h3 id="11ad">V. 11th century AD</h3>
          <p>Damascus steel was developed in the Middle East in the 11th century, mainly used for manufacturing sword blades. Damascus blades were manufactured in the Near East from ingots of wootz steel that were imported from India and Sri Lanka. They were renowned for their capability to be honed to a very sharp edge and their resistance to shattering.</p>
          <h3 id="12ad">VI. 12th century AD</h3>
          <p>By the 12th century, Sri Lanka was the world’s largest supplier of crucible steel.</p>
          <h3 id="18ad">VII. 18th century AD</h3>
          <p>By the 18th century, steel was becoming widely renowned as an extremely valuable material with many uses. However, it was still quite expensive to make, and was produced in limited quantities for special applications like armour, tools and weaponry.</p>
          <h3 id="19ad">VIII. 19th century AD</h3>
          <p>Steel production never really began reaching its potential until the creation of the Bessemer Process in 1855. British metallurgist Sir Henry Bessemer realised that molten iron could be combined with oxygen. By blasting air through the molten iron ore, the carbon content was reduced. At first, the carbon content was reduced too much, and further experimentation led to the addition of spiegeleisen — a compound of iron, manganese and carbon — to the Bessemer Process. The manganese helped remove the excess oxygen in the form of manganese oxide, and the carbon that was left behind was at the appropriate level to produce steel. Along with plastic injection moulding, the Bessemer Process was one of the most important manufacturing developments of the modern era.</p>
          <h3 id="20ad">IX. 20th century AD</h3>
          <p>The Bessemer Process and other steelmaking processes that had developed alongside it became obsolete in 1950 with the introduction of basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) which limits impurities and can even process old scrap metal into steel, lowering wastage and increasing efficiency. These days, BOS accounts for the majority of steelmaking processes in the industrialised world.</p>
